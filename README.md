There are various mini games programmed using Python. Starting from classic games such as Tic-Tac-Toe to more hardly heard games such as n-Queen.
The game's rules are shown below:


1. Tic-Tac-Toe "\n"
   Two players alternately mark the spots on a three by three grid with an X or an O to play the game. 
   The winner is the player who successfully arranges three of their marks in a row that is either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
   
2. Notakto
   is a tic-tac-toe variant. It is played across three 3 x 3 boards: Board A, board B and board C.
   There are two players: Player 1 and player 2. Player 1 always starts. Both players play the same piece: X
   Each player takes turn placing an X on the board in a vacant space (a space not already occupied by an X).
   If a board has three X in a row, column, or diagonal, the board is dead and it cannot be played anymore.
   The game ends when all the boards contain three X in a row, column, or diagonal, at which point the player to have made the last move loses the game.
   
3. n-Queen
   game is inspired by the Eight Queens Puzzle. It played on a size of board that users are free to determine. The user has to make sure
   that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
   First, the user will be asked to supply the value for n. Next, the user will enter the positions of the n queens.
   SUCCESS will be shown if no queens are attacking each other. FAIL if there are queens attacking each other. 
   
4. Connect Four
   is a connection game in which two players take turns dropping discs into a (6 x 7) board, i.e., 6 rows x 7 columns. 
   The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
   The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
   
Happy playing!
